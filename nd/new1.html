		<h2>Shri Mookambika</h2>
		<p>Mythology holds that at the Kollur Mookambika Temple lived a demon named Kaumasura, 
		who unleashed terror upon the gods by the special powers he obtained from Lord Shiva. While the gods were trying their best to stay away from him, 
		good news came that the demon would face death. Learning of his impending doom, 
		Kaumasura undertook severe penance. Lord Shiva appeared, asking the demon what boon he would like to be granted. 
		Sensing that grave danger would come of the demon if his boon was granted, Saraswati, 
		the goddess of speech took away his ability to speak. Kaumasura came to be known as Mookasura or the mute demon. Thereafter, 
		the goddess mobilized all the powers of the gods and killed the demon, and hence she came to be known as Mookambika.
		The place where Mookabika killed the demon came to be known as Marana Katte.</p>
